# Data
The data shown here is a medical study in which mice infected with a virus were given various doses of two medicines and then checked 2 weeks later to see if they were still infected. Given this data, our goal is to create a classification model than predict (given two dosage measurements) if they mouse will still be infected with the virus.

You will notice the groups are very separable, this is on purpose, to explore how the various parameters of an SVM model behave.
